## Detailed Risk Entries

### RISK-FR01-01 — External API Schema Break

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **risk_id** | RISK-FR01-01 |
| **fr_tag** | [FR-01] |
| **category** | Technical / External Dependency |
| **description** | Telegram or LINE changes their webhook event payload structure (field renames, removals, type changes) without a deprecation period, causing `parse_telegram_update` or `parse_line_event` to produce empty or incorrect `UnifiedMessage` fields silently. |
| **likelihood** | 2 / 5 — Both APIs are versioned and relatively stable; breaking changes are announced, but unannounced minor schema shifts have occurred historically. |
| **impact** | 4 / 5 — Silently malformed `UnifiedMessage` propagates to the knowledge layer producing spurious escalations or empty responses; affects all users on the changed platform until detected and patched. |
| **mitigation** | (1) Maintain golden-path payload fixtures in `tests/test_fr01.py` tied to specific API versions. (2) Emit structured WARN log (FR-09) on missing required fields during parse. (3) Subscribe to Telegram Bot API changelog and LINE Developer News for schema announcements. (4) CI snapshot tests catch regression on fixture payloads before deploy. |

### RISK-FR01-02 — 3-Second Webhook Response SLA Breach

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **risk_id** | RISK-FR01-02 |
| **fr_tag** | [FR-01] |
| **category** | Performance / Operational |
| **description** | Downstream processing (DB query, knowledge-layer rule match, PII masking) pushes total handler time past 3 seconds, violating the NFR-02 p95 latency constraint and the SAD.md adapter constraint that requires `200 OK` within 3 s of receipt regardless of downstream outcome. |
| **likelihood** | 3 / 5 — Cold-start in Docker, PostgreSQL connection acquisition under load, or synchronous knowledge-layer evaluation can each add 1-2 s; combining them exceeds the budget. |
| **impact** | 4 / 5 — LINE retries unacknowledged webhooks causing duplicate message ingestion; Telegram silently drops events for which no `200` was returned; NFR-02 breach triggers SLA alert. |
| **mitigation** | (1) Decouple acknowledgment from downstream processing: return `200 OK` immediately upon successful parse, then process via background task or queue. (2) Add p95 latency metric to MONITORING_PLAN.md. (3) Docker Compose healthcheck (FR-13) ensures PostgreSQL and Redis are `healthy` before API container accepts traffic, eliminating cold-start DB failures. (4) Set hard request timeout at the ASGI layer (e.g., 2.5 s) to fail fast and surface latency issues. |

### RISK-FR01-03 — Unsupported Telegram Message Types Cause Silent Data Loss

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **risk_id** | RISK-FR01-03 |
| **fr_tag** | [FR-01] |
| **category** | Technical / Functional |
| **description** | `parse_telegram_update` defaults any non-text Telegram message (photo, voice, sticker, document, location) to `MessageType.TEXT` with an empty `content` field (`build/lib/omnibot/adapters/telegram.py:18`). This produces a structurally valid but semantically empty `UnifiedMessage`, which is invisible to callers and to ops. |
| **likelihood** | 4 / 5 — Real Telegram users routinely send photos, stickers, and voice messages; any customer-service bot will receive these immediately in production. |
| **impact** | 3 / 5 — Knowledge layer receives empty content → confidence 0 → triggers unnecessary escalation. No error is raised; the silent default masks the actual message type in logs. Degrades FCR metric (NFR-01) for non-text interactions. |
| **mitigation** | (1) Add explicit type dispatch in `parse_telegram_update`: map known non-text types to `MessageType.IMAGE / STICKER / LOCATION / FILE` with empty `content`; preserve `raw_payload` for Phase 2 media handling. (2) Emit `WARN` log (FR-09) when `message.get("text")` is absent, including the raw Telegram message type. (3) Add acceptance test for photo/sticker payloads in `tests/test_fr01.py`. Phase 2 extends non-text content extraction (SPEC/omnibot-phase-1.md:269). |

### RISK-FR01-04 — LINE Batch Webhook: Only First Event Processed

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **risk_id** | RISK-FR01-04 |
| **fr_tag** | [FR-01] |
| **category** | Technical / Functional |
| **description** | `parse_line_event` uses `events[0]` exclusively (`build/lib/omnibot/adapters/line.py:29`). LINE Messaging API delivers multiple events in a single webhook call (e.g., a `follow` event bundled with an initial `message` event). All events after index 0 are silently discarded. |
| **likelihood** | 3 / 5 — LINE batch delivery is documented behavior and occurs in practice on group joins, follow events, and high-throughput scenarios. |
| **impact** | 3 / 5 — Subsequent events in the batch are dropped with no log entry; users whose events are at index ≥ 1 receive no response, lowering FCR (NFR-01). |
| **mitigation** | (1) Short-term: emit `WARN` log when `len(events) > 1` so ops is aware of dropped events. (2) Medium-term (Phase 2 prep): refactor `parse_line_event` to return `List[UnifiedMessage]` and update the router to dispatch all events; update `tests/test_fr01.py` with multi-event fixture. |

### RISK-FR01-05 — Webhook Secret Rotation Causes Complete Platform Outage

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **risk_id** | RISK-FR01-05 |
| **fr_tag** | [FR-01] |
| **category** | Operational / Security |
| **description** | Rotating the Telegram `bot_token` or LINE `channel_secret` (e.g., due to credential leak or scheduled key rotation) immediately invalidates all in-flight HMAC verification (FR-02), causing 100% of webhook requests for the affected platform to return `401 AUTH_INVALID_SIGNATURE` until the new secret is deployed. |
| **likelihood** | 2 / 5 — Planned rotations are infrequent but required; unplanned emergency rotation (credential exposure) can occur at any time without advance notice. |
| **impact** | 5 / 5 — Complete platform outage for the affected Telegram or LINE channel; all user messages are rejected until deployment completes; no graceful degradation path. |
| **mitigation** | (1) `platform_configs.webhook_secret_key_ref` (SRS.md:193) stores secret references rather than plaintext, enabling secret-manager-side rotation without code deploy. (2) Implement dual-secret grace period: accept either old or new secret for a configurable window (e.g., 60 s) during rotation. (3) Document rotation runbook in MONITORING_PLAN.md: update secret-manager value → verify new signatures in staging → remove old secret after TTL. (4) Alert on consecutive `401` spikes (threshold: > 5% of requests over 30 s) to detect accidental rotation. |
